The standard iOS photo editor features a clean, minimalist, and non-destructive interface designed for quick and intuitive edits. The layout is divided into three primary regions: a top navigation bar, a central image preview area, and a bottom control panel. This structure ensures that the focus remains on the photo being edited, while controls are easily accessible at the bottom of the screen. The interface uses a tabbed system at the bottom to switch between major editing functions, with context-sensitive controls appearing just above the tabs.
Top navigation bar
Purpose: The bar at the top provides navigation controls and a central title.
Elements:
Cancel/Done: On the far sides are "Cancel" and "Done" buttons for discarding or applying edits.
Title: The title of the editing tool is displayed in the center.
Central image preview
Purpose: This is the main canvas where the user's photo is displayed and where they can see edits applied in real-time.
Interaction:
Live preview: As adjustments are made via the bottom controls, the changes are immediately reflected in this area.
Before/After: The user can tap and hold the image to temporarily view the original, unedited version for comparison.
Bottom control panel
Purpose: This region houses the primary editing controls and is context-sensitive based on the selected tool.
Structure:
Primary tabs: A set of icons along the very bottom of the screen allows the user to switch between major editing categories, such as Adjust, Filters, and Crop.
Contextual controls: A sub-panel appears above the primary tabs with controls specific to the selected category. For example, selecting Adjust reveals a horizontal slider for fine-tuning specific parameters like brightness or exposure.
