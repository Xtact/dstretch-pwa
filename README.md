Bottom tool panel: A menu at the bottom that holds the editing controls and tools.
Prompt examples: "Primary tool panel at the bottom of the screen," "Panel uses a tab bar with icon-based controls," and "Editing options slide up from the bottom."
Editing controls: The sliders, buttons, and other inputs for making adjustments.
Prompt examples: "Control options appear in a sub-panel above the main tool panel," "Use a horizontal slider for adjustments like brightness and contrast," and "Adjustment buttons use circular icons." 


The standard iOS photo editor features a clean, minimalist, and non-destructive interface designed for quick and intuitive edits. The layout is divided into three primary regions: a top navigation bar, a central image preview area, and a bottom control panel. This structure ensures that the focus remains on the photo being edited, while controls are easily accessible at the bottom of the screen. The interface uses a tabbed system at the bottom to switch between major editing functions, with context-sensitive controls appearing just above the tabs.
Top navigation bar
Purpose: The bar at the top provides navigation controls and a central title.
Elements:
Cancel/Done: On the far sides are "Cancel" and "Done" buttons for discarding or applying edits.
Title: The title of the editing tool is displayed in the center.
Central image preview
Purpose: This is the main canvas where the user's photo is displayed and where they can see edits applied in real-time.
Interaction:
Live preview: As adjustments are made via the bottom controls, the changes are immediately reflected in this area.
Before/After: The user can tap and hold the image to temporarily view the original, unedited version for comparison.
Bottom control panel
Purpose: This region houses the primary editing controls and is context-sensitive based on the selected tool.
Structure:
Primary tabs: A set of icons along the very bottom of the screen allows the user to switch between major editing categories, such as Adjust, Filters, and Crop.
Contextual controls: A sub-panel appears above the primary tabs with controls specific to the selected category. For example, selecting Adjust reveals a horizontal slider for fine-tuning specific parameters like brightness or exposure.

In an iOS photo editor using the MVVM design pattern, the View is the user interface (UI) displaying the photo and edit controls, the Model holds the photo data and editing state, and the ViewModel acts as a bridge that translates user actions from the View into commands for the Model, and then transforms Model changes into a format the View can display. This pattern separates concerns, making the app more testable and maintainable by keeping UI, data, and logic distinct. 
View
What it is: The UI layer, which could be a UIViewController or a SwiftUI View. 
Responsibilities:
Displays the photo and the editing tools (like sliders for brightness, contrast, etc.). 
Sends user interactions (like a tap or slide) to the ViewModel. 
Subscribes to changes in the ViewModel and updates itself accordingly, typically through data binding. 
Model
What it is: The data and business logic layer.
Responsibilities:
Holds the actual photo data (e.g., a UIImage object or raw pixel data).
Stores the current state of edits (e.g., current brightness, contrast values).
Performs the actual image editing operations (e.g., applying a filter or adjusting a level).
Handles saving or loading images from storage. 
ViewModel
What it is: The intermediary layer that sits between the View and the Model. 
Responsibilities:
Exposes properties that the View can bind to, which represent the data to be displayed (e.g., brightnessSliderValue, currentPhoto). 
Contains the logic for user interactions, such as handling a request to increase brightness. It translates this into a command to change the Model. 
Formats data from the Model into a view-friendly representation. For example, it might take a raw image and a set of adjustments from the Model and prepare a final image to be displayed in the View. 
Listens to changes in the Model and updates its own observable properties, which in turn triggers the View to update itself.
